## ‚ú® Features

### üöÄ **cpuUpscale**
- Performs **Bicubic**, **Lanczos**, and **Edge Directional Interpolation (EDI)** upscaling with **multi-threading** enabled.
- Supports up to **x8 scaling** from the original image with a maximum resolution of **8K**.
- Utilizes **OpenMP** to parallelize loops at the CPU level, speeding up the upscaling process.

### ‚ö° **cuUpscale**
- Performs **Lanczos** and **Edge Directed Interpolation (EDI)** upscaling using **CUDA C/C++** with support for **CUDA 12**. (Updated from original 11.8 build)
- Capable of scaling images up to **x16** and handling input/output images with resolutions up to **32K** without overflow issues.
- Quadratic loop complexity (**O(n^3)** worst case), but efficiently parallelized across **Streaming Multiprocessors**.
  - Tested on **RTX 3080Ti** with **80 SMs**, successfully upscaling from **4K to 16K** with high performance.
